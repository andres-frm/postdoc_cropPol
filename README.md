## Acknowledgments

We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments that improved the final version of the manuscript. AFRM is deeply grateful to the CONICET and the Argentinian state for the public education policies that financed his PhD and his training as a researcher. We are in debt to Tucumán and Entre Ríos blueberry producers for allowing us access to their fields. The blueberry growers associations APAMA and APRATUC, helped us to contact the blueberry producers.
